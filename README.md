# k8s-env

`k8s-env` is a wrapper tool designed to protect the secrecy of your Kubernetes kubeconfig files. It provides secure access to your cluster credentials by fetching the kubeconfig from a password manager or other secret storage only when needed, and automatically deletes the kubeconfig if it hasn't been used for a configurable period.

An install script is included, which will prompt you for the command(s) you

- Wraps `kubectl` or `helm` using shell aliases for seamless usage
- Fetches kubeconfig securely from a customizable command (e.g., password manager, secret store)
- Automatically removes kubeconfig after inactivity to reduce exposure
- Easy to configure for different secret storage backends

## Prerequisites

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) and/or [Helm](https://helm.sh/) installed
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster
- A password manager or secret storage system for kubeconfig retrieval

## Usage

1. **Clone this repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/k8s-env.git
    cd k8s-env
    ```

2. **Install into your home directory:**
    run k8S_install.sh to install the scripts.
    You will be prompted for the commands you wish to wrap (usually `kubectl`, `kubeadm` and `helm` ) but will work with anything that needs KUBECONFIG set.
    You will also be prompt for a command with will retrieve your kubectl from your secret store. {eg. `pass`, `op` etc}

3. **Activate the environment**
    Source the generated init script (k8senv-init)
    Set the K8SENV_CLUSTER as a name for the cluster you are which to access in the environment - this will be passed as an argument to retrieval command you specified in the previous
    step.

4. **Use as normal:**
    Run `kubectl` or `helm` commands as usual. The wrapper will handle fetching and cleaning up the kubeconfig automatically.

    > **Note:** Any changes made using `kubectl config` commands (such as adding contexts or users) will not be persisted, since the kubeconfig file is automatically deleted after periods of inactivity. To make permanent changes, update your kubeconfig in your secret storage backend.

## Environment Variables

There are three environment variables which control how this wrapper behaves:

    - K8SENV_DWELL: This is time from running the last command on a cluster to the 
    kubeconfig being deleted. The default is 300 seconds.

    - K8SENV_CLUSTER: This is the 'cluster name', it doens't have to match anything in the
    kubeconfig, its' just to distinguish between different kubeconfig files. It is passed the secret store retrieval routine, and also is used to form filename used for storage of
    the kubeconfig and other files.

    - GETKUBE: This is the command that is call to get the kuebconfig file.

Also set in your environment should be:

    - K8S_LIB_DIR: This should contain the path of the library to find the 
    shell scripts used to keep the envvar running.

and during the running of the command `KLOCKPID` is set to a unique value for the
current invocation.

## Inspiration

The concept for `k8s-env` was inspired by [Mikael Gr√∂n's article on using 1Password to securely manage kubeconfig files](https://blog.mikael.green/post/1password-kubeconfig/). This project builds on those ideas to provide a more general and flexible solution for securely handling Kubernetes credentials from any secret storage backend.
